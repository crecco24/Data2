# Data2
Implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree with bag properties. In order words, a tree can possess multiple occurences of the same object (which is accounted for via a multiplicity value attached to a given key)

The interface consists of two objects: branches and leaves.

The program allows the user to: 
  -add (multiple) elements 
  -determine cardinality
  -determine emptiness
  -determine membership
  -remove (multiple) elements
  -union multiple bags together
  -intersect multiple bags
  -determine the difference between multiple bags
  -determine equivalence of multiple bags
  -determine if a bag is a subset of another
  -print out bag
